"Work in Progress" prototype of a platform for visualizing and relating climate action data. Aiming to display e.g.
CO2 emissions (in all available granularities) and the corresponding CO2 reduction plans. Making it possible to
qualify the current state of climate action and to find actionable insights:

- Get to know the most effective measures for any emission source
- Learn about dimensions and relations between emissions sources
- Identify missing measures on any granularity
- Compare, combine and enrich different sources of emission data
- Strategize a complete conclusion how to solve the climate crisis

A backend api prototype supporting this frontend can be found [here](https://github.com/nottmey/climate-platform-api).
